## About The Project
Umbrella Cinema: A First Year Triumph in Interactive Development!

In our term 4 project, as First-Year students, we embarked on a journey to master responsive development using Bootstrap. Our goal: to create a seamless movie streaming website for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

But that's not all! We dove deep into the world of GIT collaboration, as a team of four, to build and maintain our project repository. Together, we designed and developed a mock web streaming service - a Video On Demand (VOD) platform.

Umbrella Cinema is a testament to Bootstrap's magic, ensuring an enjoyable experience on various screen sizes. Our site's content dynamically populates from a movie database API, guaranteeing fresh and exciting choices.

And the best part? We're live! Umbrella Cinema is hosted on a server powered by Axxess, ready to bring movie magic to your screens.

Join us on this learning journey, and let's explore the world of cinema together!
